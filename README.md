Modeled in OpenSCAD.

## Modifications

I modified the plan to make it much larger. It's custom for a big peice of MDF I had laying around. I skipped the bottom shelf for now. I made add one later, or just put some 2x4s across or something.

I also made the back posts taller and made the top back rail out of a 2x6 to make a bit of a backstop for the work surface.
